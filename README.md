## Background
Welcome to the newsroom! I have just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. I'm tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.
The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
As background, the data set included with this assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. For reference, MOE stands for "margin of error."


## My Task

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler (Required Assignment)

I have created scatter plots between two of the data variables provided, such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age. I have actually created and analyzed four such plots.
Each includes a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I've coded this graphic in the app.js file of my homework directory, making sure I pull in the data from the data.csv file provided by using the d3.csv function. 

State abbreviations are detailed in each circle. Axes and labels are situated to the left and bottom of the chart.

### Bonus: Impress the Boss (Optional Assignment)

Since D3 allows me to interact with my data, I have further modified my graphic so that it dynamically reorients data points per the specific analysis undertaken. Additionally, I have incorporated d3 tooltips to reveal a specific element's data when users hover their cursor over a given element.
