          <h2>Correlations Between Health Risks, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>When examining the relationship between poverty and a lack of healthcare, a positive correlation exists. As evidenced by the data, when the percentage of
            poverty increases there seems to be a higher percentage of people lacking healthcare. This is not surprising since states with lower poverty rates tend
            to have a relatively higher income population that can work and afford healthcare.</p>

          <p>Regarding the last statement above and when comparing median household income to a lack of healthcare, an apparent inverse situation (or negative
            correlation) is observed. It is clear that the majority of those states with high levels of uninsured people also reflect a relatively lower level of
            household income. Few states actually have both high household income and a high level of uninsured population percentage.</p>

          <p>In a different analysis, Age vs. Smokes, a low correlation is evident. The majority of the states lie relatively close together in the middle of the chart.
            Across most states the average smoker age lies between 34 and 44 years, representing 15% to 25% of the overall population.</p> 
          
          </p>Looking at obesity we see a negative correlation with respect to median household income. One can infer the following conclusions around this scenario: 
          Individuals with higher household income are more readily able to address their health, diet, and fitness. These people can afford a healthier diet and have
            the means to join gyms and participate in fitness programs. On the other hand, lower income individuals do not possess such levels of disposable income and
            are therefore not as likely to afford such pursuits. Unfortunately, they may be less motivated to exercise and at the same time gravitate toward inexpensive
            fast food, of which both can contribute to obesity.<p>
